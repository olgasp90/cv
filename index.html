                <p> <em>Software Engineer Student at <strong> Springboard</strong></em>  </p>
                <p> I'm Olga, a medical school graduate with a strong passion for software engineering. As I worked in the medical field, I became intrigued with how effective software design could solve problems related to the clinical appropriateness and usability of eHealth technologies, caused by the insufficient end-user engagement in the design process.
My previous experience in medicine dovetails perfectly with my strong interest in designing healthcare applications that will benefit both patients and practitioners.
I am a fast learner, hard working and detail oriented person. I'd like to work as a member of a team, where I can be a key contributor for the company's success.</p>
